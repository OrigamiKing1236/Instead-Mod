# Instead Mod
This mod is being rewritten and the pre-releases are here on Modrinth. I know this mod has some weird names, so open an issue on my GitHub with a better name for something. (I am open to renaming anything)

**Please report all bugs to the [issues](https://github.com/OrigamiKing3612/Instead-Mod/issues) page**

## What this mod does
-**This mod adds a new dimension**: The Instead Dimension. The dimension has every type of ore in it and these new ores drop double the normal drops. The Instead also has acid in it. Soon the acid lake biome will have a structure in it.

-**A new entity**: The Saphither. The Saphither is in the Instead and attacks you. They are similar to Ghasts.

-**Ores**: Fools Gold, Saphire, and Energy. The fools gold does nothing right now but it will later. The sapphire is used to make the portal to the Instead
